# **Audio Transcription Web App**

A web application that allows users to record audio via a microphone and get real-time transcription using the Deepgram API. The app offers a seamless experience for recording, transcribing, and displaying the transcribed text. 

## **Features**

- **Microphone Recording:** Users can record audio through their browser’s microphone.
- **Real-Time Transcription:** Transcribed text is provided in real-time using the Deepgram transcription API.
- **Visual Feedback:** A microphone button shows recording status, and a visual wavelength effect is displayed during recording.
- **Responsive UI:** The app is fully responsive and works well across different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling for audio recording issues and transcription errors.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React, Web Audio API / MediaRecorder API
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap)
- **Transcription Service:** Deepgram API (Streaming Transcription)
- **State Management:** React's useState and useEffect hooks

## **Installation**

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-transcription-web-app.git
cd audio-transcription-web-app
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Set Up Deepgram API**

1. Sign up for a free Deepgram account at [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/).
2. Get your API key from the [Deepgram dashboard](https://dashboard.deepgram.com/).
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Deepgram API key:

```
REACT_APP_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key
```

### **4. Start the Application**

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Usage**

1. Click the **Microphone Button** to start recording.
2. The application will send the recorded audio to the Deepgram API for real-time transcription.
3. As the audio is recorded, the transcribed text will be displayed on the screen.
4. Click the **Stop Recording** button to stop and save the transcription.

## **Features to Implement**

- **Deepgram Integration:** The app currently simulates the audio recording and transcription process. Full Deepgram API integration is planned for real-time transcription.
- **Save Past Transcriptions:** Implement a feature to save and display past transcriptions.
- **Styling Improvements:** The current app UI can be improved using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for a more polished look.
- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for the components and their functionality.
